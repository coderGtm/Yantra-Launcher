![Yantra Launcher Store Cover](https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher/assets/66418526/1e998174-5481-4b5d-96bb-3ebc7e4d857e)

A Minimal CLI-based Android App Launcher.

## Variants
Yantra Launcher is available in 2 variants:
1) Minimal
2) Pro

The minimal version is for those who want the bare minimum set of commands and features. On the contrary, the Pro version has a wide array of useful commands and features. Both these variants are available to download from the Play Store. The Pro version is priced to support the project.

## Pre-built Official versions
Pre-built packages are recommended for most users as the app uses some Google Play Services (as much as I feel bad about it) which are ensured  to be present on your device while downloading from the Play Store.

1) [Minimal Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderGtm.yantra)
2) [Pro Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderGtm.yantra.pro)

## Building
> [!NOTE]
> Building and running locally might not give you the smoothest experience. Play Store builds are optimized for your device and language settings and are much smaller in size.

To build and run locally, clone this repository onto your local machine and open it with Android Studio.
```
git clone https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher.git
```

A `local.properties` file will be generated by Android Studio that contains all local configurations for your IDE. Add the following lines in it to specify environment variables used by Yantra Launcher:
```
weatherAPIkey="your-weather-api-key"
backupPassword="your-backup-password"
```
Leave these values as it is or feed in your weatherapi.com API key if you want to test the `weather` command.

Sync the project to download the required Gradle repositories and any other dependencies required by the project.

Now you should be good to go ðŸš€...

From the Build Variants tab, select the variant you wish to build. The minimal variant is aliased as 'free', which gives you the following configurations to select from:
1) freeDebug
2) freeBeta
3) freerelease
4) proDebug
5) proBeta
6) proRelease

Select your desired configuration before you build and run the project.
