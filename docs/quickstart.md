# Quickstart
This page aims to get you quickly started with Yantra Launcher on your Android device. It will be covering Installation and basic information about commands and their usage.

## Installation
Yantra Launcher is available in 2 variants:

1. Minimal
2. Pro

The minimal version is for those who want the bare minimum set of commands and features. On the contrary, the Pro version has a wide array of useful commands and features. Both these variants are available to download from the Play Store. The Pro version is priced to support the project.

### Pre-built Official Versions (Direct Download)
Pre-built packages are recommended for most users as the app uses some Google Play Services (as much as I feel bad about it) which are ensured  to be present on your device while downloading from the Play Store.

1) [Minimal Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderGtm.yantra)
2) [Pro Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderGtm.yantra.pro)

### Building
For building the app yourself, see [here](https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher?tab=readme-ov-file#building)

## Usage
Once you get the app, open it and _tada..._
Welcome to Yantra Launcher! Your wallpaper will be gone and a solid black terminal background will be made available. Some text and a blinking cursor will be waiting for you below it!

The first thing you should _(or rather must)_ do now is type `help`. Notice how the bottom suggestion bar changes as you type to make it easy for you. Hit enter and you will see a long text output. This is a short introduction to every command you can use in this terminal. Once you are done reading it, I am sure you can do basic tasks like launching apps.

## Setting as the Default Launcher
When you are somewhat comfortable with Yantra Launcher, you can set it as your default Launcher so every time you unlock your phone or exit an app, you go back to your Terminal Home Screen.

To do so, type `settings` and hit Enter. A GUI settings page for Yantra Launcher will open. Find the setting for selecting the default Launcher and click on it. It will show all the available Launchers on your device. Select Yantra Launcher and choose "Always". Yantra Launcher will now be your Home Screen.
Enjoy!
